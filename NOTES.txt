	zdroj - https://techiescamp.com/lessons/evolution-of-containers/
	Containerization is not a new technology, despite what some may think. In fact, Google has been utilizing container technology in its infrastructure for years.

	The concept of containers actually dates back to the 1970s with the introduction of chroot, a concept that allowed for the changing of a process’s root directory.

	Since then, many container-based projects have been developed, with some starting as early as 2000. Here is a list of such project
