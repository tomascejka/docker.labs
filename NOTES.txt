	Containerization is not a new technology, despite what some may think. In fact, Google has been utilizing container technology in its infrastructure for years.

	The concept of containers actually dates back to the 1970s with the introduction of chroot, a concept that allowed for the changing of a process’s root directory.

	Images and Containers, Registries and Repositories¶
	Images are read-only templates composed by stacking up other images. They are hosted on docker registry.

	Containers is an instance of an image.

	Registry is where we store our images. You can host this yourself or use Docker’s public registry called DockerHub. Repositories are repos within the registry where images of a particular type are stored.

	Docker Hub - is a public registry. Official repos are encouraged to be used as they are vetted by Docker and ensure they get security updates frequently. Generally, user created repos have a prefixing username/repo_name/image_name. Usually, tags are used to specify docker versions.
